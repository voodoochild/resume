        <p>I’m a skilled full-stack developer, focusing on the front end, with over 8 years of
          professional experience including large, complex projects. I enjoy working closely with
          design and user experience, taking features through from early prototypes to high–quality
          production code. As a veteran gamer of 25 years, I want to bring that passion into my
          working life by moving into the video games industry and working alongside, and for the
          benefit of, people who love the same things that I do.</p>
